  <h1>Understanding CSS Positioning</h1>

  <!-- Fixed positioning -->
  <!-- <div class="box blueBox fix">Fixed</div>
  <div class="box greenBox fix">.fix</div>
  <p><em>Fixed positioning</em> &rsaquo; &rsquo;fixes&rsquo;
    the position of an element relative to the browser window.
    The element always stays fixed in place, even when scrolling.
  </p> -->

  <!-- Absolute positioning -->
  <!-- <div class="container-abs">
    <div class="box blueBox abs">Absolute</div>
  </div>
  <div class="box greenBox abs">.abs</div>
  <p><em>Absolute positioning</em> &rsaquo; takes an element out of a document flow, meaning the browser acts as if the
    element has no width and height, and the other elements on the page move up as if it was never there. The position
    of the element is then fixed relative to the top leve container, or the closest parent with a set positioning.
  </p> -->

  <!-- Relative positioning -->
  <!-- <div class="container-rel">
    <div class="box blueBox rel">Relative</div>
  </div>
  <div class="box greenBox rel">.rel</div>
  <p><em>Relative positioning</em> &rsaquo; sets the position of an element relative to its original position. The
    element's original width and height is retained in document flow and other elements behave as if it was in its
    original position.
  </p> -->

  <!-- Static positioning, inherit & z-index -->
  <!-- <div class="container-st">
    <div class="box blueBox st">Static</div>
  </div>
  <div class="box greenBox st">.st</div>
  <p><em>Relative positioning</em> &rsaquo; is the default behaviour of elements. <em>Inherited position</em> &rsaquo;
    tells an element to inherit its positioning from its parent element. <em>Z-index</em> &rsaquo; controls the vertical
    stacking order of elements. Elements must have a set positioning for z-index to work.
  </p> -->

  <!-- Floating -->
  <!-- <div class="box blueBox flt">Float</div>
  <p><em>Floating left</em> &rsaquo; removes an element from normal flow. It then takes that element and pushes it to
    the far left as possible. Other elements will move up as far as possible to flow around the element and take its
    original space.
  </p>
  <p><em>Floating right</em> &rsaquo; removes an element from normal flow. It then takes that element and pushes it to
    the far right as possible. Other elements will move up as far as possible to flow around the element and take its
    original space.
  </p> -->

  <!-- Floating multiple element & clear property -->
  <!-- <div class="box blueBox flt-m">Float Multiple</div>
  <div class="box greenBox flt-m">.flt-m</div>
  <p><em>Floating</em> &rsaquo; positions an element according to document flow, and then moves it to the far left or
    right as possible. Elements following a floated element will move up as far as possible.
  </p> -->

  <!-- Centering elements -->
  <div class="container-ctr">
    <div class="box blueBox ctr">Centre</div>
  </div>
  <!-- <div class="box greenBox ctr">.ctr</div> -->
  <p>One of the most commonly asked questions is how to <em>center elements</em> since there is no option to float
    center. But by thinking carefully about how elements behave, we can use positioning to achieve the same result.
